    <h1>All about how a cartoon character made me fall in love with creating my own animations</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is cherry, welcome to my page dedicated to my favourite cartoon character doraemon and also sharing my insights about how a cartoon character made me take up <b>cs</b> as my major for my graduation and letting me expand my creative levels.</p>
    <h2>Here's the photo of doraemon have a look:</h2><pre>                                                                      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT8j0dXNPErFIQAaYaUbMEbAyMpCBrAym_7BQ&s"alt="Doraemon image"></pre>

                <h2>~The way i fell in love with this cartoon</h2>
                <p>So, i was in my second grade when i saw this cartoon for the very first time. I was so mesmerised by the blue creature in the cartoon. It is none other but <big>Doraemon.</big>Daily i would watch this cartoon and even wished to have one.</p>

                <h2>~Falling for the animations and willing to make my own</h2>
                <p> well apart from falling for the blue cat i even fell for the way in which it was created. That blur character has a huge impact on me and a lil hope arised wishing i would also one day create such cute cartoon, and even wished to add my own voice over to it. Little did i knew that i day i'll be introduced to making it.</p>
